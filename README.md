# POLIGLOZ


Have you ever wondered if there is an API that allows you to translate any sentence and any language or even dialects into your
applications of any type of platform such as web, desktop, mobile and any operating system.
There is a google API that apparently is very closed and only allows to translate as google applications.
That's why Poligloz came up with an API that will allow these activities mentioned above, and I hope
that it is possible to translate film subtitles, live streams, websites, applications built with it
in php, react, react native, flutter, java, c, and etc.
This is a good and great OPEN-SOURCE project without any profit.


## HOW TO INSTALL?
